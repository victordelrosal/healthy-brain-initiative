                    <h4>The Greystones Model</h4>
                    <p>In Greystones, Co. Wicklow, parents across <strong>8 primary schools</strong> came together and agreed: no smartphones until secondary school. This removed the peer pressure that makes individual family decisions so hard.</p>
                    <p>The model has since spread to <strong>Clare, Dublin, and Waterford</strong>. Minister for Education Norma Foley cited it when announcing national guidelines.</p>

                    <li><strong>Screens off one hour before bed</strong> · let the brain wind down</li>
                    <li><strong>Homework and chores first</strong> · screen time is earned, not default</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech-free Sundays</strong> · regular disconnection for the whole family</li>
