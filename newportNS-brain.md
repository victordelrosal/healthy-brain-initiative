Talk for Parents and Teachers.

 

Electronic Media and the Developing Brain: What

Parents and Teachers Need to Know for a Truly

Smart Generation.

Speaker: Paula Healy, BA (Hons), MSc..

 

Paula completed an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University

of Sussex, England. Her research thesis focused on computer game

playing and addiction. Since then, she has given seminars on the

effects of excessive screen exposure, in schools in England, to parents,

teachers and teenagers. Paula moved to Sligo recently and is now

giving talks in Irish schools.

You will be aware of the common-place use of screens (smart phones,

iPads and computers) amongst young people.

Concerns are regularly raised through the scientific community,

education and mental health professionals on the long-term adverse

effects of compulsive screen use on education and mental health.

Young people today live in an age of anxiety, loneliness, distraction

and addiction and this has unfortunately multiplied in the last few

years.

Screen related issues are apparent both inside and outside the

classroom. Increasing scientific and observational evidence of the

impact of technology on young people ranges from addiction,

attention deficit, anxiety, learning difficulties, delayed development

due to lack of movement and play, lower academic performance,

obesity, sleep deprivation, aggressive behaviour and undeveloped

social skills.

 

The last decade has seen a sharp rise in mental health issues in young

people and there is a strong relationship with smartphone owenership.

In August 2024, Professor Matthew Sadlier (Irish Medical

Organisation), said “We need to treat smartphones and social media use as a

public health emergency.” The ramifications on their mental

health are huge.

The talk will identify the many serious issues around excessive

electronic media exposure in the psychologically vulnerable young

brain. The content aims to help parents navigate these times and

support their children to develop in an optimal way. Ultimately, it will

help the children feel happier, find school and homework easier, have

better memory and focus and feel calmer and more connected with

their peers.

 

Lecture Content:

• What are the risks if screens are a primary source of stimulation?

Why should we be concerned?

• What are the emerging problems associated with excessive

screen time?

• What is the relationship with mental health issues?

• Hooked – habit-forming products don’t happen by chance. Who

are the brain villains, the thieves who take young people’s time

and steal their life vision and purpose.

• How screens under-stimulate the most important parts of the

brain and what this means for learning, memory and mood.

• Social media encourages social comparison, reduces self-esteem

and causes anxiety and depression. We are at crisis point with

mental health issues and young people.

• What can we do to help our young people interact with these

devices consciously and productively and still develop healthy

integrated brains.

• Alternative enriching activities to build resilience and boost

brain function, optimizing mood, memory and learning.
